## Work Plan
https://github.com/users/Thundeee/projects/2/views/1
I have kept track of my work using Github Projects.

## All in all
Under this assignment I didn't have to much because I had alot on my plate this week. 
If I had more time there are some key features and improvements to my code that I would have made.
I would have taken my time to take the DRY principle more into account. This was on my work plan but I didn't have enough time for it and instead of solving the problems I had with import/export, I copy pasted code from one file to another. 

I would also have documented my code more and was planning to do so when I was goning to implement DRY.

As additional features I would add reactions to posts and a profile page for each user. Also the option to Follow other users would be fun and interesting.

##In the end
This was a fun assignment and I felt I learnt a lot doing it. I wish I would have more time this week myself since I was enjoying developing this site.
